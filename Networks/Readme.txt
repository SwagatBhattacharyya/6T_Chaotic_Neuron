This folder contains six script files:
DefineNeuronParams.m:: This generates NeuronParameters.mat, which is used by all the scripts below. If you need to make any changes to neuron circuit or triangle generator circuit parameters for any of the scripts in this folder, made these changes here and run it.  
TestStandaloneNeuron.m:: Plots the current step response of the barebones chaotic neuron model. Feel free to change the current level on line 10 or to change the functional form of the input current altogether.
TestStandaloneTriangle.m:: Plots the response of the triangle generator circuit ODE model.
SingleNeuronSynapseTest.m:: Plots the current step response of a 1 neuron network -- that is, a chaotic neuron cascaded with a triangle generator with no feeedback. You can modify this code to simulate a more complex network of neurons by adjusting the following: Params.NeuronPopulation on line 9, Params.ReservoirWeight_Mat on line 10, and the plotting code on line 31-37. Please see 'Synfire_2Neuron.m' and Section V of the paper to see how the weight matrix might be modified.  
Synfire_2Neuron.m:: Plots the disturbance and post-disturbance response of a two-neuron chaotic oscillator feedback network in the time domain and in the phase plane, respectively. Please feel free to vary 'SynapseBias' on line 9 to observe the synchronization behavior as a function of synaptic coupling strength. This code corresponds to Fig. 9(a-c) in the paper. 
ChaosCommunication_2Neuron:: Demonstrates masking and unmasking of an input signal using phase-locked chaotic oscilators. This code corresponds to Fig. 9(d) in the paper.
