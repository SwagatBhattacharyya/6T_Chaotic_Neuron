# 6T_Chaotic_Neuron
Simulation code for a six-transistor chaotic IF neuron design 

There are two subfolders in this directory, which contain:
# Networks
- Code to analyze the behavior of a single chaotic neuron
- Code to analyze the behavior of a standalone triangle generator (which, together with the synapse emulates a Rall Alpha function).
- Code to analyze the synchronization behavior of a network of chaotic neurons with excitatory connections.
- Code to demonstrate chaotic masking and unmasking using coupled chaotic oscillators. 
# Parametric_Sweep
- Code to analyze the spike rate, Lyapunov exponents, and orbit diagram as a function of Beta_s, Beta_m, and VFG0.
- Code to analyze the Lyapunov exponents and orbit diagram as a function of input current.
